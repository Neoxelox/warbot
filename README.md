# WARBOT
Just a Discord WARBOT. *Conquer the entire world!*

### Requirements
- ```.env``` file inside ```/src``` with ```USER_TOKEN=(discord generated token)```
##### Node packages
- dotenv
- discord.js
- colors
- node-fetch
- nedb
- svg.js
- svgdom
- svg2png
- imgur
- table
- randomcolor


or ```npm install```

**Note:** The bot generates a log, which by default prints to the console. If you want a permanent log file run the bot with ```> something.log``` parameter.

### Suggested Improvements
- AFK/Timeout for players who don't use their turn
- Kick players of a party (Take a similar approach as leave command)
- More complex invite command that doesn't require sending the party password
- Add the posibility of losing population through either a successful or not attack.
- Add more stats for the countries, maybe add buildings and troops ðŸ¤”


This project is my first 'big' project using Javascript/NodeJS and obviously all the packages mentioned above. Constructive critics are more than welcomed.
